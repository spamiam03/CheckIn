## Description
Create a web-application that can be used by gyms or other companies, where people can check-in and pay (if required) in a simple and quick way.

## Vision Statement
A Check-In program that is easy to use for both customers and employees.

## Motivation
+ A check-in app allows for desired features to be added without a lot of complexity.

## Risks
+ The biggest risk is that this app becomes useless. It needs to be simple enough to win by means of convenience.
+ Several Team members have little to no experience working in web design.

## Mitigation stratagy for dealing with risks
+ We have several member with personal experience in the areas we hope to market this software to.
+ One of the team members has exceptional past experience working with web design.

## Requirements
We anticipate that we will encounter several requirements that will dicate the success or failure of the application. Due to the application being a Software as a Service application (SaaS), we inherit additional requirements that must be fufilled in order for our application to be a useful and a successful tool.

### User Requirements
+ The system interface will be user friendly, it will integrate several frameworks to create a sleek, modern ui.
+ The system will be fast, a user should not wait more than .5-2 seconds for the page to load.
+ The system should be able to store several locations in the database and allow for users to customize each location to their liking (different buildings, etc)
+ The system should be able to bill, and store peoples information for record keeping and promotional purposes
+ The system should be low cost for entry level businesses and then scale cost wise for locations and customers

### Functional Requirements
+ The system should scale and accomidate 1000+ simultaneous connections/requests
+ The system should allow for as many locations as a customer requires (as long as number scales with cost)
+ The system should allow for large venues (large amount of customers)
+ The system should scale horizontally (more servers, rather than vertically *more resources)

### Non-Function Requirements
+ The system created by this team will need to be up for 99.5% (SLA) of the time
+ The system will need to be compliant to current privacy, and user information standards
+ The system will be responsive, working on both desktop, laptop, and mobile devices

## Methodology
+ We will be using the agile style of project development
+ This style will encourage us to work often in small sprints
+ Also, this will allow us to be constantly working on the system and prevent procrastination
